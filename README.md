## Installation & Running Locally

1. Download and unzip the project folder
2. Open a terminal in the project folder
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open your browser at: `http://localhost:5173`

## WhatsApp Number

The WhatsApp number for bookings and orders is set in two files:
- `src/components/products/products.jsx` → line with `const WHATSAPP_NUMBER`
- `src/components/therapists/therapists.jsx` → line with `const WHATSAPP_NUMBER`

Change `254700123456` to the clinic's real number (country code + number, no + sign).

## Browsers Tested

- Google Chrome ✓
- Microsoft Edge ✓
- Mozilla Firefox ✓

---

## Assumptions Made

1. The clinic's phone number and email are placeholders and should be updated before deployment.
2. Product images are from the local assets folder.
3. Gallery images are loaded from Unsplash (requires internet connection).
4. The WhatsApp redirect assumes the clinic has WhatsApp Business on the number provided.
5. The visitor counter uses localStorage — it counts per browser, not globally.
